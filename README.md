## SVG Graphic

## Description
This repo includes 3 different logos. In the HtML I had put all of these logos in their own divs and all 3 divs in a section. I had used the svg tag to incorporate the svg's and the parts of the svg's includes the class element. The SVG's colours and are made by using CSS.

### CSS
I have made two separate css pages one purely for colours and the other includes width, height, resets and fonts. I have also included a media query at the max-width of 50rem, this allows the logos to have different colour schemes than the original. 

### HTML
Inside the HTML I have included comments as to which section represents which part of the SVG. I had added space in-between these comments for readability, this is not normally how I add comments, however, I wanted to make it easier for Tony to scan and locate these comments.
